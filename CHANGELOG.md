All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.0.7] - 2025-10-16

### Added

- **CommonJS module format support**: Full support for `module.exports` alongside ES6 `export default`
  - Automatically detects and loads both module formats
  - Can mix CommonJS and ES6 modules in the same project
  - Examples: `export default (req, res) => {...}` and `module.exports = (req, res) => {...}`
- **Enhanced handler loading**: Improved `loadHandler()` function to properly handle multiple module formats
  - Explicit checks for ES6 default export
  - Dedicated CommonJS module.exports handling
  - Better type safety and error messages

### Changed

- **Improved handler loading logic**: More robust detection of module formats with better type checking
- **Documentation update**: Added module format section to README explaining both formats

## [0.0.6] - 2025-10-15

### Added

- **Hoa.js Framework Support**: Added automatic support for Hoa.js web framework
  - Automatic framework detection and registration
  - Support for Hoa.js-specific syntax: `app.route('METHOD /path', handler)`
  - See HOA_GUIDE.md for detailed integration instructions

### Fixed

- **Route counting bug**: Now only counts successfully registered routes instead of all discovered routes
- **Framework detection**: Improved detection logic to identify Express, Koa, Fastify, and Hoa.js

## [0.0.3] - 2025-10-15

### Added

- **Filename-based routing**: Support for embedding paths in filenames to reduce folder depth
  - Example: `users.[id].posts.[postId].get.ts` â†’ `GET /users/:id/posts/:postId`
  - Maintains backward compatibility with folder-based structure
- **Custom separator support**: Allow custom separators for filename-based routing
  - Default: `.` (dot)
  - Configurable: `separator: '_'` for `users_[id]_posts_get.ts`
- **Depth limiting**: Prevent overly complex routes with `maxDepth` option
  - Routes exceeding depth limit are ignored
  - Default: 10 levels deep
- Enhanced file convention documentation with examples for both approaches

### Changed

- **Code refactoring**: Eliminated duplicate parameter parsing logic
- **Improved maintainability**: Split complex functions into focused, single-purpose functions
- **Better error handling**: More robust route extraction and validation
